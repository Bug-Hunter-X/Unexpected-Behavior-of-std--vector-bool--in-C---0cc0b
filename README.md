# Unexpected Behavior of std::vector<bool>
This repository demonstrates the potential issues with using std::vector<bool> in C++.  std::vector<bool> optimizes space by packing booleans, but this leads to performance penalties and unexpected behavior compared to other standard containers.

## Issues:

* **Slower element access:** Accessing individual elements is slower due to bitwise operations.
* **Inefficient insertion/deletion:**  Inserting and deleting elements can be less efficient than with other vectors.
* **Non-random access iterators:**  Algorithms requiring random access iterators won't perform optimally.
* **Comparison issues:** Direct comparison of elements might not behave as expected.

## Solution:

Consider using `std::vector<char>` or `std::vector<int>` (if memory is less of a concern) instead of `std::vector<bool>` to achieve better performance and avoid unexpected behavior.
